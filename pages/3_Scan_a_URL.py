    # --- Uses --- #

    1.) Create a webpage simply by creating a python (".py") file in the "pages" directory. With the streamlit library, this project's file structure automatically creates pages in the
            web app when you create a ".py" file in the pages directory.

    2.) Given a user-provided URL - and upon pressing either "enter" or clicking on the "Check Threat" button - upload the URL to a virustotal
            url-receiving-endpoint (via POST request), then request an analysis of that URL (via GET request).

        2a.) This is achieved by leveraging python's built-in requests library for making API requests, a free-to-use personal API key from VirusTotal,
                and two user-made functions to isolate the POST requests from the GET requests.

        status = results['data']['attributes']['status']

        # Problem: The response from the GET request doesn't always include all attributes
        #   necessary to build the data charts.

        # Solution: Create the attributes_status variable to contain what ends up being
        #   a list of dictionaries. Create the attributes_found variable and initialize it
        #   to false. Run a while loop to iterate through each "key : value" pair to check
        #   for a "value" in any key to be greater than 1. If any "value" is greater than 1
        #   then set attributes_found to True. We use the attributes_found variable for error
        #   handling. If 30 seconds pass by and attributes_found is still not equal to True,
        #   then print out that an error occured.

        # Explanation: This works because all of the "values" in each "key : value" pair are updated
        #   at the same time (I.e. The data is either there - or it's not). So, once any one of
        #   the values are equal to, or greater than 1, we can assume the virustotal analysis
        #   endpoint is finished with its analysis. See code below for implementation.
